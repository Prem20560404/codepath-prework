## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
While completing this submission, the challenge that I encountered is making a GIF to show the feature of the game. I tried the provides resuoreces in the pre-work description, but nothing worked for me. So, I decided to go in another way. I first recorded the screen using the in-built screen recorder, trimmed that recording using video editor, and finally used screenToGIF (https://www.screentogif.com/) website to get the GIF. I had experience of working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I had no experience of working with audio content in JavaScript. I followed up the definitions or summary provided in the pre-work, and some YouTube vidoes to understand the use of audio content in JavaScript before implementing them in the pre-work. For technical part, it was a challenging to understand some of the functions in JavaScript. I reviewed my notes on JavaScript to understand the JavaScript functions used in the prework.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
After completing the submission, the first question that popped in my mind was how can I make this game available to people in internet. The game was not realistic eough, so I wondered what are the ways to make the game more realstic. The game looks nice while playing in laptop screen, but what will happen if I play this game in my mobile phone screen? I questioned myself how the websites are able to adopt the screen of different size, what technology is used to make the websites responsive. Also, how other kind of JavaScript events can be implemented to make this game more interesting, such as playing some kind of audio when the user start the game and loss the game.  

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would firstly spend my time choosing the background and the color of buttons that looks attractive together. I would then invest my time in adding the music to the button instead of just a beep sound. I would also add some features like popping the notification within the screen when the player win or loss game instead of pooping it as a alert, generating a random pattern every time the player start the game, time limitation for the player to click the button after the computer clicks the buttons, and life bonus for player when they beat their highest score. Lastly, if I left with more time then I would spend time in making a user login and sign up feature so that players will have their profile to see their highest score so far, and also choose the different theme for the game as they like.
